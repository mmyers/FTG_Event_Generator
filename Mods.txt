=== Instructions for using EventGen with mods ===
=================================================

Event Generator will work with mods once the appropriate text files are
modified.


Country names and tags:

1. Open text.csv with Excel or similar (I use OpenOffice).
2. Find the section that deals with tags (search for MIN).
   Remove everything except columns A and B of this section. Make sure there
   are no DESC's left.
3. Select everything. Select Data->Sort and sort by Column B (ascending).
   Note that you could sort by Column A if you'd rather.
4. Select column A and copy. Create a new text file and paste it in. Do the
   same for column B. This way, the names are in the same order as the tags
   (this is very important!).
5. Rename your new text files appropriately and put them in the Data
   subdirectory.


Provinces (only needed for new maps):

1. Open province.csv with Excel or similar (I use OpenOffice).
2. Select everything. Select Data->Sort and sort by Terrain (make sure the
   option for column labels is selected).
3. Delete all rows in which Terrain >= 5 (that is, keep anything with 4 or
   less). This gets rid of oceans, rivers, and permanent terra incognita.
4. Select everything again and sort by Name.
5. Copy columns A and B to text files. Remove the labels from the beginning.
6. Rename your new text files appropriately and put them in the Data
   subdirectory.


Note: Obviously, you shouldn't save changes to text.csv or province.csv after
doing all this sorting and deleting. :)
