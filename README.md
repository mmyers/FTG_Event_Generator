### For the Glory and EU2 Event Generator

This program allows a user to create many in-game events that differ only in minor ways. For example, it's simple to generate a series of events to switch AI script files for a country every 10 years, or a set of events for every province in the world that fire once certain conditions have been met.

All of this could be done faster and easier by a modder with the ability to write any kind of text-editing script, but this tool is for those who don't have the time or inclination.

This program was originally written between 2005 and 2007. Its source code was lost in 2015 and still hasn't been found. The source code in this repository, at the time of first commit, is a version generated by the Procyon decompiler with a few minor style edits.
