*** 1.21 ***

Additions:
-It is now possible to use ${tag} and ${provid} in triggers and actions.
 When creating templates with ${tag} and ${provid} in the trigger or the
 actions, they will be replaced by garbage values in the actual templates.
 However, when loading the templates, the garbage values should be
 automatically replaced by the correct macros, so this should be invisible
 to the user.
-Added data files for Interregnum in Data/Interregnum. They can be enabled by
 moving them into Data/, overwriting any files of the same name (backups are
 recommended).

Changes:
-There is now a checkbox for generating events without countries.
 "(No country)", which was in the country selection box, has been removed.
 As a result, it is now possible to select several countries and generate
 events without countries. This, in combination with the new ability to have
 ${tag} in the trigger and actions, allows the creation of a series of events
 that are _about_ countries, rather than _for_ countries.
 Idea from a conversation with MattyG.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed a bug with exporting text for events with two or more actions (the
 second action name was always the same as the first).


*** 1.2 ***

Additions:
-Added facility for exporting event texts to text.csv. The generator adds a
 comment at the start of the generated events containing all the necessary
 lines for text.csv. The text.csv lines are generated in the standard format:
 EVENTNAMEXXXX, EVENTHISTXXXX, and ACTIONNAMEXXXXA/B/C/D.
 Also added a menu item to allow the user to pick the column that text will
 be generated into. (Requested by sturmvogel)
-In conjunction with the above, added support for loading events in AGCEEP
 format with texts commented after the fields. The comment immediately
 following the relevant field is assumed to be the text for it. This will not
 work well with Paradox events.

Changes:
-Comments no longer are generated with a space between the '#' and the start
 of the comment text.

Bugfixes:
-Event descriptions should now load properly.
-A few other minor fixes.


*** 1.1 ***

Additions:
-Added support for multiple countries (finally!).
-Macros are now smarter (i.e., many macros now have more than one allowed
 construction).
-Added file "Mods.txt" explaining how to use with mods.
-Added country tags and names for AGCEEP 1.51 in Data/AGCEEP. They can be
 enabled by moving the files into Data/, overwriting the existing files.
-Added capability for templates. Templates are stored in the Templates
 subdirectory, with the master template list in Templates/template-list.txt.
 Events can be saved as templates, meaning that exactly one event will be
 generated, and no macros will be expanded. Feel free to post any user-made
 templates on the main thread at
 http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=264451.
 Templates can be quickly loaded through the File->Templates menu.
 Two example templates ("AI_switcher.txt" and "Screenshot reminder.txt") are
 pre-loaded.
-Added "Set user name" menu item to Options menu.


Changes:
-Major reworking of the interface to accomodate the new country/id table. As
 a side-effect, the window is no longer resizable, since it destroys the new
 interface.
-Separated data from GUI.
-Moved options into a menu, then changed my mind and put them back (but kept
 the menu).
-Disabled "AI only" option, because it did not work with "ai = no".
-Header comments no longer include a line of hashes before and after.
-Moved changelog into THIS file.

Bugfixes:
-Miscellaneous fixes; I can't remember specifics, but I think there were quite
 a few. :)


** 1.04 **

Additions:
-Added ${user} macro. The username is stored in eg.conf, which must now be
 edited by the user. (Thanks to Tskb18 for the suggestion!)

Changes:
-The default file header comment now includes the user's name and the date
 on which the file was generated. (Thanks to Tskb18 for the suggestion!)


** 1.03 **

Additions:
-Added some macros to event header comments; see Macros.txt for more info.
-Start and end dates can now be parsed from the triggers of random events.

Changes:
-Changed the layout of the event-loading window.
-Widened the preview window; now horizontal scroll bars will not always show.

Bugfixes:
-Start and end years will now work properly when "Increment dates" is selected.
 Previously, they would be incremented before printing the first one, so all
 dates would be off by <increment> years.
-Random events no longer print the start date when it is -1.


** 1.02 **

Additions:
-Added several mnemonics and accelerators, for what they're worth. :)

Bugfixes:
-Ending month and day are REALLY printed correctly. :)
-Random events no longer have dates and deathdates printed (except in the
 trigger).
-Province-based events no longer have three decimal places after the province
 ID.
-Selecting "none" as the country for a random event now works correctly.
-Fixed several issues with loading events.
-The preview window now opens at the start of the text instead of at the end.


** 1.01 **

Additions:
-Non-random events without start/death dates are now possible.
-Setting offset to -1 gives an event with no offset.
-Setting endyear to -1 gives an event with no endyear.

Bugfixes:
-Ending month and day are now printed correctly.
